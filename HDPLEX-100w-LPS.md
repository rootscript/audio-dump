HDPLEX 100W Linear Power Supply is a unique quad voltage output linear power supply designed for computer audio system. It features high quality R-Core transformer, ELNA capacitors for audio application, Linear Technology LT1083 7.5A Low Dropout Positive Fixed Regulators.
The HDPLEX has 4 independent rails , 5V, 9V, 12V, and 19V … with total capacity of 100W. 19V and 12V are using XLR output. 9V and 5VDC are using GX16-2 output connector. Each output rail is using one LT1083 for best performance.

Housing inside passive aluminium chassis with heavy duty heatsink panel, HDPLEX linear power supply will remain 100% fanless, cool, and silent.

I spent a lot of time investigating Linear PSU’s and I narrowed it down to a Linear PSU with at least 2 rails, with both 12V and 19V available.
I ruled out Paul Hynes which is very well thought of, mainly due to cost and wait times (his is probably the Rolls Royce of PSU’s), though I was looking at his best PSU which is nearing $1K I believe.
So with a budget of less than $1K …. the contenders were PPA (Paul Pang Audio) and HDPLEX.
Paul Pang products are also highly respected (like Paul Hynes and Teddy Pardo products), Paul Pangs PSU was about $599 shipped though I found it difficult to find much feedback on the web.
I liked the price of the HDPLEX ($358) … though the HDPLEX also had one feature that really appealed to me, that is it used an R-Core transformer.
R-Core transformers appeared better than Toroid transformers (in a PSU).
The HDPLEX PSU had a R-Core transformer so that is what influenced me to purchase it.
The other thing with Regulated Linear PSU’s to watch for is the amount of ripple (that is how good is the Regulators in the PSU).
The HDPLEX has very low ripple … plus they got it measured (as well as getting it CE approved).
It was a extremely close call between the PPA (due to his very good reputation) and the HDPLEX, though for the reasons above is why I went with HDPLEX.

This linear power supply is reportedly built around a high quality R-Core transformer, Linear Technology LT1083 low dropout positive fixed regulators, and ELNA capacitors to provide low ripple and noise. There are no super exotic custom regulators, silver wiring, or Teflon film capacitors in site, but solid, sensible parts have been wrought together in a solid chassis. What’s even more useful is that it provides dual outputs, 19VDC and 12VDC, both of which can be used simultaneously. The 19VDC output powers Micro Zuma, while the 12VDC output can power any audiophile device that requires 12VDC. Aerospace GX16-2 connectors provide DC output, and conveniently, the power supply comes with different size barrel connectors to GX16 cables.
