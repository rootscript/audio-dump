##Best sounding SS rectifiers? [link](http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/power-supplies/187863-best-sounding-ss-rectifiers.html)
I've been using Vishay HexFRED with excellent result.
I read that Cree SiC Schottky is excellent too, but I haven't tried it.
I also have some Diotec soft recovery rectifiers and they are good sounding too.
Has anyone done comparisons on these top notch rectifiers? Which one is the best?

- The Fairchild Stealth diode made a very big negative impact on the sound.
Music lost its "sparkle" and "magic" - eveything became too even sounding. No part of the music "jumped out" and the bass disappeared. yes the highs were smooth, but everything else sounded "wrong".

There are a few other diodes worth mentioning after my ventures in diode land:

- Vishay 1N5062 avalanche diode (the grey glass bead, do an ebay search): softer mids, bit less detailed, but nevertheless a very good 'middle of the road' diode with excellent hi end extention. will be an upgrade in cheap or harsh equipment.
- (TSC) 1N5819 Schottky diode: cheap upgrade for cheap equipment, but sounds hyped. may leave a nice first impression, but will fatigue in the long run. if you need some extra high end in a dull system these are worth to try, they cost pennies.

Well, I have experimented a lot with diodes over the past months, and it certainly is audible in a standard CLC regulated low voltage power supply!

- 1N4148: cheap but nasty compared to Sic diodes, an upgrade in cheap equipment, but sounds 'hyped' IMHO. A bit too bright for me.

- Vishay HEXFRED: excellent midrange, but loses some highs and little less tight in the bass. My choice for guitar amplifiers.

- Cree Sic: best diode i have tried so far, unfortunately also the most expensive...still the difference is big enough (to me) to justify the price.

Diodes do make a difference in 99.9% of the appliances, because all commercial designs will cut costs at the PSU!!! (no snubbers, no elco bypass caps, single stage filtering before regulator)
Why do tube freaks (being one of them) still swear by tube rectifiers?
Why do most people prefer a linear psu over a smps?
all for the same reasons you can't hear?


I think you will find:

- 1N4148: very fast, but no soft recovery, will have measurable overshoot. explains the 'brightness', if you filter this out you will lose more than you bargained for?
- Vishay hexfred: ultrasoft recovery, made to decrease overall part cost of psu. my guess is that recovery is too soft for audio purposes. my guess is that Fairchild stealth has the same problem.
- Cree SiC: Zero Reverse Recovery Current, Zero Forward Recovery Voltage, High-Frequency Operation, low capacitance. it is simply a very good diode
