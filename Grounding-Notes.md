Noise Control

Noise can be differential mode (hot to neutral) or common mode (neutral to ground), but will only have an effect on the common-mode noise.

To control noise and interference, one needs to create a low-impedance ground system that is effective not only at 50/60Hz but also at much higher frequencies (tens if not hundreds of megahertz).
To achieve this objective, supplemental conductors such as ground straps, grounds planes, ground grids, and so on may be required.

Earth Grounds

It is a myth that connecting equipment to an earth reduces noise and interference.
