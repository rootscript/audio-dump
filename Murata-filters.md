It is a choke coil for attenuating common mode noise, which causes problems on equilibrium electrical line. It is effective against common mode noise in the several MHz ~ number of 100MHz. It is ideal for noise control video and audio signal line and DC power line, the balanced electrical interface cable.

Common Mode Choke Coils(CMCC) reduce the common mode noise that is problematic in differential transmission (examples: USB, HDMI and Mipi), balanced transmission, power supply lines, and audio lines.
They are ideal for suppressing common mode noise with frequencies ranging from several megahertz to several hundred megahertz with no adverse effect on the signals (upper cut-off frequency).
Products can also be searched by series lineup or application.

Is a high current, noise measures in a wide frequency band in one product is possible. It is a super high performance noise filter of SMD type. It is most suitable for noise suppression in DC power line. You can use it to communication equipment and FA equipment.
