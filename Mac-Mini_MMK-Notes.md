#Mac Mini DC-conversion/Linear Fan Controller Kit (MMK)

The Late 2014 Mac Mini model is MUCH easier to work on than the 2010-2012 units.

Get them with just the PCIe Flash Drive and not the HD or Fusion drive so as not to have any SATA bus drive active. In theory the PCIe Flash drive--being directly connected to the PCIe bus controller--should sound as good as the SD card, just monstrously faster. Though just like the RAM in a computer, there is a LOT of high-speed switching going on and the PCIe Flash Drive could have greater emissions.

I do think that avoiding the SATA bus is very much a part of what makes the SD card trick work so well for SQ. So the PCIe Flash should sound very good.

Network shared storage and a BlueJeans/Belden Cat6a cable is my recommendation for full music library storage and playback. Thus an optimal 2014 Mac mini would have just a PCIe Flash drive and the only attached cables would be a DC cable for power (got to ditch the SMPS and PWM fan pulses!), the USB cable to the DAC, and an Ethernet cable (bypass the EN switch or use a fiber optical LAN isolator).
