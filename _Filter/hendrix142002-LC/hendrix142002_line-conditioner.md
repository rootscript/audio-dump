###My DIY Line Conditioner


Just did a line conditioner based on the circuit of Jon Risch [link](http://links.dalrun.com/Electronics/Docs/Surge_Protection/files/AC%20Filter%20&%20Surge%20Suppresor.htm). I don't have funds for expensive stuffs.

I had used the following:

1) 2pcs - high current, radial,bobbin, PCB mount, 100uH, 7.8A, 0.033 Ohm
RS components - 228-589

2) 1pcs - Suppression, capacitor,radial, PCB mount,delta, classX2/Y, 275Vac, 0.1uF+2x4.7nF
RS components - 239-668

3) 1pc - Mundorf Supreme cap

4) 2pcs - Evox Rifa Y suppression caps

5) others - 2pcs AC socket, Silver plated wires, metal housing, IEC socket

So far, it brought a quiter background, small detail had came out and quite a surprise, even the bass has improved. It took around 80hrs before everything stabilize though.

Please take note:

The use of Mundorf or other non rated X or Y capacitors are not supposed to be used in AC application. Do it at your own risk.

My latest creation. Single output. A few friends ask me to make for them. They just need to connect their power distributor.
